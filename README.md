# aur_tools
My scripts I use to handle AUR stuff
Including but not limited to:

* Version checks/comparison
* Find orphaned files
* mycpan2aur PKGBUILD script
* A partridge in a pear tree
* Maybe my AUR to Jenkins app
* A really fine pastrami recipe.

Enjoy and use responsibly. 
I hold no responsibility if the use of any of these scripts break things.

Also, listen to Enslaved!!
